# DevX - Intelligent System Supporting Project Requirements Analysis

## Market Problem
Analyzing project requirements efficiently can be challenging, especially when ensuring quality and collaboration among team members. Traditional methods may lack flexibility and adaptability to specific project needs.

## Our Solution
DevX is an AI-powered system designed to provide comprehensive analysis of project requirements and quality. By allowing users to select from different AI models, it offers flexibility and adaptability, ensuring precise project support and improved team collaboration.

## How We Build the Project
We begin by adapting AI models for image selection and text generation. Users can input queries based on three parameters:
- **For Who:** Identifying the target audience.
- **Doing What:** Defining the action or context.
- **Additional Information:** Providing extra details to refine the analysis.
